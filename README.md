# Print Cards
## What

This extension adds a print option to the backlog which allows you to print the cards for use on a physical scrum board.

## Why

Having a physical scrum board can allow those inside and outside the team a quick view location for the status of the work and the act of moving physical cards has a more real and tangible feel than just clicking on a screen.

## Prerequisites

A Visual Studio Online project and some work items.

## Usage

Install the Extension in your account. Go to the backlog and click the print button (in the top right corner of the screen).
